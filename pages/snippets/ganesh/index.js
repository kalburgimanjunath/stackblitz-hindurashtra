        Ganesha, also known as Lord Ganesha or Ganapati, is one of the most
        widely worshipped deities in Hinduism. He is revered as the remover of
        obstacles, the god of wisdom, knowledge, and new beginnings. Ganesha is
        easily recognizable by his distinctive elephant head and human body.
        According to Hindu mythology, Ganesha is the son of Lord Shiva, the
        destroyer, and Goddess Parvati, the mother goddess. His birth story
        varies in different texts, but a common version involves Parvati
        creating Ganesha from her own body and appointing him as the guardian of
        her chamber. When Shiva tried to enter the chamber, Ganesha, unaware of
        Shiva's identity, blocked his way. Enraged, Shiva severed Ganesha's
        head. Overcome with remorse, Shiva replaced Ganesha's head with that of
        an elephant, thus granting him a new life. Ganesha is depicted with a
        large, elephant-like head and a pot-bellied body. He is often portrayed
        sitting or standing with one leg bent and the other resting on the
        ground. He is depicted holding various objects, including an axe to
        remove obstacles, a noose to capture ignorance, and a modak (sweet
        dumpling) symbolizing the rewards of spiritual practice. Ganesha is also
        accompanied by a mouse or rat, which represents his ability to overcome
        challenges of all sizes. Ganesha is widely worshipped before starting
        any new endeavor, as he is believed to bring success, wisdom, and good
        fortune. His festival, known as Ganesh Chaturthi, is celebrated with
        great enthusiasm in many parts of India and by Hindus around the world.
        During this festival, idols of Ganesha are installed in homes and public
        places, and devotees offer prayers, sweets, and flowers to seek his
        blessings. The festival typically concludes with the immersion of
        Ganesha idols in water bodies, symbolizing his return to his divine
        abode. Ganesha's popularity extends beyond Hinduism, and his image and
        symbolism have also been adopted in various Buddhist and Jain
        traditions. He is regarded as a benevolent and compassionate deity,
        accessible to all, and is worshipped by people seeking guidance,
        success, and the removal of obstacles in their lives.
